Reasearch was split into two parts, specs and prices. My part being the specs. After presenting the report, Fasial gave us the green light to proceed and create the VM's neccessary for the task. While trying to create the VM's we ran into permission issues. At first I wanted to ask Faisal but Finn insisted that he would be able to get it working from home. That pretty much signalled the end of the session for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Session 2</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Unable to create the VM's from home due to 'pricing' errors it was my turn to try. Once again, permission issues were the problem. Faisal was able to grant access to creating the VM's for us. After creation of the first VM I was unable to connect via SSH and RDP(Remote Desktop Connection). My theory was that it was</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">-</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-style: normal;">RDP, firewall</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">- &nbsp;SSH, public key error</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">I was unable to resolve the issue this day and documented the issues I came across. Hopefully get it done before next session.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Note:</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Turns out the issue as to why I couldn't RDP onto the VM was because of a basic error, you cannot RDP on Azure to Linux machine</span></p></blockquote>

Perhaps it was because the tutorial was for ubuntu 20.04 and the VM I had installed on Azure was 18.04. We decided to create a new VM with ubuntu 20.04 and restarted the tutorial once again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Before the 2nd session of the week we we're able to finally get RT installed and running on the VM.

The good news that came out of this week was our site was finally up and running locally on Azure, or so we thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">With the default credentials we had created we were able to sucessfully login onto our RT site. However, we later found that it was unable execute tasks such as creating tickets, users, groups, and other database related stuff. The error it had given us was a CRSF issue. I was unable to fix it on my end so I passed it on to Finn.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">The solution he had found was that it was because the ip address had not been whitelisted for access. I wasn't sure myself what this meant so i left it for Finn. Long story short he fixed it and we were back on track with our RT system. Creating tickets was now a sucess!</span></p></blockquote>

Finn and I caught up to discuss what has been done since the break as well as updating Faisal and Rob.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">In the end Finn and I agreed that we may need to purchase an actual domain and neither of us wanted to spend out of our own pocket. Faisal suggested talking to Rob about it so we did. After brief discussions, he told us that we could use a current DNS at polytechnic as some of the services hosted on it was underused. Rob planned on shutting it down while also mentioning to look over some of the applications on there and getting rid of the unused ones. We decided not to touch any of it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Deploying the DNS itself was an easy task. Simply adding RT to the DNS zone 'op-bit.nz' on the Azure portal. The only hard part was coming up with a name for our RT. I brought up the idea of it to be named 'isaacrt.op-bit.nz' after one of our members Isaac Thomas similar to the 'kate.ict.op.ac.nz' server. </span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">It took some time for DNS to propagate. Mason suggested reducing the TTL 'unit' to 1 minute. This worked but for some reason only mobile devices could access it whereas PC didnt. I messaged Rob and he said it was a sync issue. Azure DNS syncing to OP then to ICT which can take a while. So I left it until the next day and it did. Another task done.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

Azure's cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets such as, API Keys, SSL, certificates, or access keys. For some reason it just so happened that I was working with SSL as well. Although, I was tasked this a while back I hadn't gotten to it as I was still unfamiliar with using Azure confidently. But this seemed like the best time to get stuck into it properly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">When I first looked into the task itself it was confusing at first as I had only ever worked with azure using the portal and powershell with little experience. So as I was following the tutorial I was trying to find the powershell equivalent for the commands given. Resources online suggested using the azure cloud shell. So I did but I needed permission to create a storage mount. At this stage I was unsure on how to proceed from there.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

And also being told my portfolio isn't enough going well amongst other things. Turns out I was pushing my portfolio to the wrong branch on Github, so it hadn't been updated since the beginning of the semester. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">I was debating on what step to take in order to secure the site. I was leaning towards the resources already provided as it had instructions on how to set it up on the VM itself and the certificate has already been created aswell, Whereas Faisal's task using let's encrypt allows you to generate a free certificate using Azure Key Vault, and from there use the generated certificate to use for RT. I went away with the latter as I was still unsure on how to use some of the Azure features at this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">I also volunteered in repurposing unused PC's through a partnership the BIT has with a charity group named Com2Tech. Basically the task involves repurposing unsused PC's so it could be donated to those in the community. Personally, I wanted to attend as much sessions as I could as the task was carried out every Friday in D312 from 330pm to 430pm. The problem was that one my rostered work days is Friday 1:15pm to 1145pm. So I had to make up hours during the week in order to free up time to attend.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p><strong>Week 6 - 8</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">The remained of the semester until the end was solely focused on preparing for the AZ 104 exam. I quickly realized just how much work and effort was needed in order to pass the exam. The modules itself was long and very informative. The recommended time to prepare was minimum 6 months of experience in terms of testing out all the different features and what can be offered on Azure. I had to try and cram all this in about 4 weeks. Doable but a very tough task to be done especially considering the pass mark is 70%.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Throughout the AZ-104 modules I learned alot and most of what I learned would have really helped in the beginning of the semester. Like the TCO (total cost ownership), a tool to help in estimating bugdets, cost for applications, deployments, and ownership for our resources we plan to use in Azure. We could have used this for writing up proposals for our RT system, and resources needed for migration of the BIT workload. The tasks that were assigned to other members of the Dev Ops team. This is just one of the many things that were could have been useful at the start.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">I attended the charity event/job at least 2 more times during this time also as I wanted to have more hands on experience in repuporsing PCs. There was a couple of sessions that required a bit more troubleshooting as not all PC's that we received were the same and some may have been damaged along the way.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p></blockquote>
