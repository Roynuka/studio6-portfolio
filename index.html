Not much else was done this day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Session 2</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Since last session our Opeations and Security team has officially formed.

Fasial wanted us to write up a report on our research, basically as like a proposal as to how we were to approach the task. After some research we figured we would use something like the ticketing system we used in the 'System Administration' paper. This is due to the fact that many in the team had previously done this paper and were familiar with using it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Session 2</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Nothing more to report other than updating with the team on what we're doing. This session was different as it had to be done via Zoom due to the pandemic and Nz being on Level 2 other than Auckland. This was done to prepare us for learning from home again incase anything like this happens in the future.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

Reasearch was split into two parts, specs and prices. My part being the specs. After presenting the report, Fasial gave us the green light to proceed and create the VM's neccessary for the task. While trying to create the VM's we ran into permission issues. At first I wanted to ask Faisal but Finn insisted that he would be able to get it working from home. That pretty much signalled the end of the session for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Session 2</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Unable to create the VM's from home due to 'pricing' errors it was my turn to try. Once again, permission issues were the problem. Faisal was able to grant access to creating the VM's for us. After creation of the first VM I was unable to connect via SSH and RDP(Remote Desktop Connection). My theory was that it was</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">-</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-style: normal;">RDP, firewall</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">- &nbsp;SSH, public key error</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">I was unable to resolve the issue this day and documented the issues I came across. Hopefully get it done before next session.</span></p></blockquote>

On Finns side he was able to log in however, I was still unable to do so on my end. For now the installation would have to continue on his PC until we're able to find a solution for my side. Other than that we're making slow progress. Hopefully able to complete the installation by the end of this week,</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Session 2</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Installation is finally underway for our request tracker vm. A lot of time was spent trying to install and fix missing dependencies that were required. In the documentation we found it stated that we mayhave to manually install some of them ourselves which was a pain.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

This tutorial resulted in less missing dependecies and I was able to fix all of it and progress further. Made more progress in 1-2 days following the new tutorial which in my book was a win. However, we may have fallen behind a bit for this ticketing system. Where we're at now is where I think we should have been at least a week ago.</span></p></blockquote>

Perhaps it was because the tutorial was for ubuntu 20.04 and the VM I had installed on Azure was 18.04. We decided to create a new VM with ubuntu 20.04 and restarted the tutorial once again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Before the 2nd session of the week we we're able to finally get RT installed and running on the VM. However, we ran into another issue. This time a CSRF security issue. After some research online I found no solution so far. Hopefully be able to get this sorted before the end of the week as this has dragged on.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Session 2</span></p></blockquote>
